* Write a function that loops over all of your questions, puts them
* in a dom element(<p></p>), and adds them to the dom, along with a text box
* element and a button.
* Give each of those text boxes and buttons an id with the number of the question
* you are on.  Tip: Use concatenation - "question" + i

* Add an on click event for each of the buttons to look at the corresponding text box
* and check for the answer.
